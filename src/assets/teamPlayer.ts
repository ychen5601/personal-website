    text: `From a young age, I understood the significance of mutual engagement, and the importance of empowering others. As a table tennis coach for young children, I was responsible for creating and executing lesson plans that strike a delicate balance of effective teaching, fun, and discipline. 
    
    I recall a moment when one of my students was struggling, his confidence waning visibly compared to his peers. I responded by dedicating extra time to him, introducing new techniques and tactics. This not only helped him catch up, but also exceed all expectations. His improvement had an effect on the entre group, elevating their performance to unprecedented levels.
    
    This experience cemented my belief in the importance of communication and inclusivity.`
