    text: `I began programming in the first year of university. At the time, I was a business student studying in Rotman Commerce, while taking introductory programming lessons in Python.
    
    Upon being introduced to the world of computer science, I developed a newfound appreciation towards problem solving with code.
    
    Since then I've worked on mobile applications, websites, hardware architecture, software architecture, and I'm looking forward to working on many more projects in the future!`}
