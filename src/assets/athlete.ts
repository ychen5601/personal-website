    description: `Athletics have been an integral part of my life since I was young. At a young age, I was introduced to competitve table tennis. I was able to create many memorable moments, and met many new friends along the way.
    
    I have since moved to working out, with the occasional hike and bouldering session. One thing hasn't changed - many new friends, and new memories made.
    
    I view athletics as not only a pastime, but a way of viewing life. Just as a strong opponent in basketball, or a heavier weight is a challenge to be met, I see life's obstacles in the same light - opportunities to grow, to overcome with practice, hard work, and dedication.`,
